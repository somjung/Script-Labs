# Week 13: Introduction to Web Scraping

This project introduces the fundamentals of web scraping using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` libraries. It demonstrates how to download HTML content from a website and extract specific information based on HTML structure.

**Important Note on Ethics and Legality:**
Always be mindful of the website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`) and their Terms of Service. Respect rate limits and avoid overwhelming servers. This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious or unauthorized data collection.

## Implemented Features

* **HTML Download**: Uses the `requests` library to fetch web page content.
* **HTML Parsing**: Leverages `BeautifulSoup4` to parse the downloaded HTML.
* **Data Extraction**: Extracts the main book title and a list of chapter titles from the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" website.
* **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for network issues and HTTP responses.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/web-scraping-intro.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/web-scraping-intro.git)
    cd web-scraping-intro
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    You'll need `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
3.  **Run the scraper:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The script will print the scraped book title and chapter titles to the console.

## Debugging Web Scraping

* **Inspect HTML:** Use your browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to inspect the HTML structure of the page you're scraping. This is crucial for identifying the correct tags, classes, and IDs to target with `BeautifulSoup`.
* **Print `response.status_code`:** Check if your request was successful (200 OK) or if there was an issue (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found).
* **Print `response.text`:** Sometimes it's useful to print the raw HTML content to see if you're getting what you expect, especially if parsing fails.
* **Check for `None`:** When using `find()` or `select()`, always check if the returned element is `None` before trying to access its attributes or text, to prevent `AttributeError`s.
* **User-Agent:** Some websites block requests without a `User-Agent` header. Adding `headers = {'User-Agent': 'Your Custom User Agent'}` can help.
* **Rate Limiting:** If you make too many requests too quickly, a site might temporarily block you. Add `time.sleep()` between requests (import `time`).

## Extension Ideas

* **Save Data to File**: Modify `scraper.py` to save the extracted data to a CSV or JSON file (`data/scraped_output.json`).
* **Scrape Multiple Pages**: Extend the scraper to navigate through multiple pages (e.g., paginate through a blog archive).
* **Extract More Data**: Beyond titles, extract links, dates, authors, or article content.
* **Handle Dynamic Content (Selenium)**: For websites that load content dynamically with JavaScript, research and experiment with `Selenium` to control a browser. (Requires browser driver setup).
* **Error Reporting**: Implement more sophisticated error logging to a file.
* **Parameterize URL/Selectors**: Allow the user to input the URL and potentially even CSS selectors.
